== ABOUT ==
Aldriana's Shadowcraft Engine is an excellent endeavour however most of the UIs I see are
fairly primitive. This isn't to say they don't get the job done but there are a lot of
tasks that need to be done when switching gear in and out and a dropdown doesn't always
give you the best information. I found myself switching in items without fully having all
the information. Therefore I decided to make a very lively (and informative) javascript
interface as well as one that allows for all relevant item data to be readily available.
I also want to allow importing directly from the armory, fully aware that once the
feed system is back it will become irrelevant & trivial.

I will also implement a storage system that will save configurations. Whether this is done
by a unique id system or dynamic url (much like how wowhead does talent configurations) is yet
to be seen.

Please note that this project is only a view to Aldriana's engine and does not actually include
Aldriana's code.
