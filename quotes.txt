In Soviet Russia, Rogue still stabs you
Sometimes I cast Dismantle on a lock and shout "Alohamora"
Rogues are soooo indy, the only people that have heard of us are dead!
People look at me weird when I ask where the poison vendor is in real life...
Rogues do it from behind!
Pro tip: A fan of knives helps keep you cool in the Barrens!
I have been ganked by real life cats waaaaay more times than by druids
I never really liked combat maces, too close to maracas...
Pro tip: Double crippling poison is way more fun than winning...
I still hide in the bushes in AB
Vanish + Gnomish Army Knife - where is your rezzer now?!
Sapping may as well be like asking if this rag smells like chloroform
I would never expect a Tauren rogue...just saying...
